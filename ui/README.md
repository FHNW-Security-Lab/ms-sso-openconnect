# Legacy UI Path

This directory is kept for compatibility with older commands.

Canonical implementation moved to:

- Shared Qt code: `codebase/ui/`
- Linux frontend: `frontends/linux/`
- macOS frontend: `frontends/osx/`

Compatibility scripts are still available:

- `ui/scripts/build-linux.sh`
- `ui/scripts/build-macos.sh`
